# Calorie Tracker App
## Charbel Bakhos
<hr>

The idea is to create an app where users can sign up, start tracking their calories and achieve their goals of weight loss, muscle gain, maintenance or any weight related achievements! 

It will also have a feature allowing users to connect with a coach who has access to see what they have tracked so far, and make any changes or updates to their diet plan.
